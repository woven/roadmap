## Roadmap

Here's what we're up to for a first release:

- Feed support, so channels can crawl external sources the community wishes to monitor.
- Ability for anyone to create new channels.
- Basic profile, showing channels you're participating in.
- Ability to manage your profile picture.

Here are some things on the horizon:

- Better mobile support, like a basic wrapped app.
- Say you're "Interested" on events; get app/email notifications some hours in advance.
- Direct link to news, events and other items.
